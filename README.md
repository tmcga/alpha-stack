# Alpha Stack

> What if every analyst had a senior MD's frameworks, a quant's toolkit, and a risk officer's discipline — loaded into their terminal?

**Alpha Stack** is an installable AI skill system for finance. 12 skills covering every major Wall Street desk, 19 computational tools with zero dependencies, and a structured workflow for investment analysis — from sourcing ideas to monitoring positions.

It turns Claude Code into a **virtual finance team**: an M&A banker who builds merger models, a derivatives trader who thinks in Greeks, a portfolio manager who optimizes with Black-Litterman, and a risk officer who stress-tests everything with Monte Carlo.

## Install (30 seconds)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmcga/alpha-prompts.git ~/alpha-stack
cd ~/alpha-stack && ./setup.sh
```

Open Claude Code. Type `/deal`. You're running.

---

## The Workflow

Every analysis follows six phases:

```
  Source ──> Diligence ──> Model ──> Stress ──> Decide ──> Monitor
    │           │            │          │          │          │
  Frame the   Research    Run the    Break the   Ship the   Track the
  question    deeply      numbers    thesis      memo       position
```

**Source** — Identify the opportunity. Frame the analytical question.
**Diligence** — Deep research using desk-specific prompt frameworks.
**Model** — Build the quantitative case. Run Python tools, sensitivity tables.
**Stress** — Pre-mortem. What kills this thesis? Who is on the other side?
**Decide** — Recommendation with conviction level, sizing, and risk/reward.
**Monitor** — Catalyst calendar, thesis-drift triggers, exit criteria.

## 19 Computational Tools

Standalone Python calculators. Zero dependencies — just Python 3.10+. Run from CLI or import as modules.

| Domain | Tools |
|--------|-------|
| **Valuation** | `dcf.py` `lbo.py` `wacc.py` |
| **Options** | `black_scholes.py` `implied_vol.py` `convertible.py` |
| **Fixed Income & Credit** | `bond_yield.py` `merton_model.py` `credit_spread.py` |
| **Portfolio & Risk** | `portfolio_risk.py` `kelly.py` `brinson.py` `black_litterman.py` `monte_carlo.py` |
| **M&A** | `merger_arb.py` |
| **RE / VC / Lending** | `cap_rate.py` `vc_returns.py` `loan_amort.py` |
| **Quant Trading** | `market_maker.py` |

```bash
# Run any tool directly
python3 tools/dcf.py --fcf 100,110,121,133,146 --wacc 0.10 --terminal-growth 0.025 --shares 100

## Claude Desktop (MCP Server)

Alpha Stack also runs as an **MCP server** in Claude Desktop, exposing all 23 tool functions as native tools. No terminal needed — Claude calls the tools directly when you ask a finance question.

### Quick Setup

```bash
./setup-mcp.sh
```

Restart Claude Desktop. The tools appear automatically (look for the hammer icon).

### Manual Setup

1. Install dependencies: `uv sync`
2. Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alpha-stack": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/alpha-stack", "python", "mcp_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```
3. Restart Claude Desktop.

### What It Looks Like

```
You:     What's the DCF value for a company with FCFs of 100, 110, 121, 133, 146?
         WACC is 10%, terminal growth 2.5%, net debt $500M, 100M shares.

Claude:  [calls dcf_valuation tool]
         Enterprise Value: $1,542,078
         Equity Value: $1,042,078
         Price per Share: $10.42
         Terminal value is 70.5% of EV.
```

## Example Session

```
You:     /deal
Claude:  Deal Execution skill activated. What deal are you working on?

You:     Sell-side M&A for a $200M revenue specialty chemical company.
         EBITDA: $60M, growing 8%. Net debt: $150M. 100M shares out.

Claude:  Let me build the valuation framework.
         [Runs DCF, LBO, and WACC tools]
         [Produces sensitivity tables]
         [Generates buyer universe with strategic rationale]
         [Stress-tests the downside: margin compression, cyclical risk]
         [Delivers valuation range: $850M-$1.1B enterprise value]
```

## Philosophy

Alpha Stack is built on seven principles documented in [ETHOS.md](ETHOS.md):

1. **Assumptions are the model** — every number is a bet; make the bets explicit
2. **Second-order thinking** — "and then what?" is the most important question
3. **Adversarial by default** — pre-mortem every thesis before it gets capital
4. **Precision over confidence** — ranges over point estimates, distributions over averages
5. **Tools verify intuition** — run the math, then interpret
6. **Cross-desk fluency** — seeing all perspectives is the edge
7. **No hallucinated numbers** — if the data doesn't exist, ask for it
