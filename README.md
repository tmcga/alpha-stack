> What if every analyst had a senior MD's frameworks, a quant's toolkit, and a risk officer's discipline — loaded into their terminal?

**Alpha Stack** is an installable AI skill system for finance. 47 skills covering every major Wall Street desk, corporate finance function, and back-office operation, 26 computational tools with zero dependencies, and a structured workflow for investment analysis — from sourcing ideas to monitoring positions.

### Why Alpha Stack?

- **Not prompts — pipelines.** Each skill is a 200-870 line execution pipeline with phased workflows, decision gates, and quality checks. Not a list of questions to ask.
- **Real math, not vibes.** 26 Python tools that run DCF, Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo, Black-Litterman, LBO, DSCR sizing, equity waterfalls, and more. Every recommendation is backed by a calculation you can verify.
- **Adversarial by default.** Every thesis gets a pre-mortem. Every valuation gets a sensitivity table. Every recommendation includes what kills it.
- **Zero dependencies.** All tools are stdlib-only Python. Install in 30 seconds. No API keys, no accounts, no subscriptions.

---

## Install (30 seconds)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmcga/alpha-stack.git ~/alpha-stack
cd ~/alpha-stack && ./setup.sh
```

Open Claude Code. Type `/sell-side`. You're running.

**For Claude Desktop** (no terminal needed): run `./setup-mcp.sh` instead. See [MCP Server](#claude-desktop-mcp-server) below.

---

## The Workflow

Every analysis follows six phases:

```
  Source ──> Diligence ──> Model ──> Stress ──> Decide ──> Monitor
    │           │            │          │          │          │
  Frame the   Research    Run the    Break the   Ship the   Track the
  question    deeply      numbers    thesis      memo       position
```

**Source** — Identify the opportunity. Frame the analytical question.
**Diligence** — Deep research using desk-specific prompt frameworks.
**Model** — Build the quantitative case. Run Python tools, sensitivity tables.
**Stress** — Pre-mortem. What kills this thesis? Who is on the other side?
**Decide** — Recommendation with conviction level, sizing, and risk/reward.
**Monitor** — Catalyst calendar, thesis-drift triggers, exit criteria.

## Personal Knowledge Base (`/wiki`)

Alpha Stack gets smarter the longer you use it. The `/wiki` skill builds a personal finance knowledge base — a persistent, local collection of markdown files that captures every company you research, every thesis you form, and every methodology preference you express.

Inspired by Karpathy's [LLM Wiki](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) pattern.

```
You:    /wiki init
Claude: Wiki initialized at ~/.alpha-stack/wiki/

You:    /wiki — ingest my AAPL analysis: services mix shifting from 22% to 35%,
        driving P/E expansion from 28x to 32x. Target $245. Key risk: EU antitrust.
Claude: Created entities/aapl.md, journal/aapl-services-thesis-2026-04-05.md
        Updated index.md with cross-references.

        --- 3 months later ---

You:    What do I know about Apple?
Claude: Per your analysis from 2026-04-05 (journal/aapl-services-thesis-2026-04-05.md):
        Thesis: services mix shift → P/E expansion to 32x. Target $245.
        Key risk: EU antitrust forcing App Store fee reductions.
```

**How it works:**
- **Entities** — company/sector pages that accumulate across analyses
- **Journal** — dated analysis records with thesis, findings, recommendation, and outcome tracking
- **Playbooks** — your preferred methodologies ("I use 10% WACC for mid-cap tech")
- **Schema** — conventions that evolve as the LLM learns your style

Everything stays local at `~/.alpha-stack/wiki/`. Nothing is committed to the repo. The wiki is yours — just markdown files you can browse, git-track separately, or back up however you want.

## Claude Desktop (MCP Server)

Alpha Stack is also a **finance MCP server** — 45 tools that Claude Desktop can call natively. No terminal, no Python knowledge. Just ask a question and Claude runs the math.

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmcga/alpha-stack.git ~/alpha-stack
cd ~/alpha-stack && ./setup-mcp.sh
```

Restart Claude Desktop. Look for the hammer icon — that means the tools are live.

<details>
<summary>Manual setup (without installer)</summary>

1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/): `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
2. Install dependencies: `cd ~/alpha-stack && uv sync`
3. Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alpha-stack": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/absolute/path/to/alpha-stack", "python", "mcp_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```
4. Restart Claude Desktop.

### What It Looks Like

```
You:    I'm looking at a company with EBITDA of $100M. Entry at 10x, exit at 11x,
        5x leverage, 6% rate, 8% EBITDA growth, 5 year hold. What are sponsor returns?

Claude: [calls lbo_returns tool]

        MOIC: 2.99x
        IRR: 24.5%

        Returns Attribution:
          EBITDA Growth:    0.9%
          Multiple Change: 27.6%
          Deleveraging:    71.5%
```

```
You:    Size a senior loan on a $28M property with $1.8M NOI at 6.25%.

Claude: [calls re_debt_sizing tool]

        Binding Constraint: LTV
        Max Loan:     $18,200,000
        Actual DSCR:  1.34x
        Debt Yield:   9.89%
        Positive Leverage: YES
```

## Philosophy

Alpha Stack is built on seven principles documented in [ETHOS.md](ETHOS.md):

1. **Assumptions are the model** — every number is a bet; make the bets explicit
2. **Second-order thinking** — "and then what?" is the most important question
3. **Adversarial by default** — pre-mortem every thesis before it gets capital
4. **Precision over confidence** — ranges over point estimates, distributions over averages
5. **Tools verify intuition** — run the math, then interpret
6. **Cross-desk fluency** — seeing all perspectives is the edge
7. **No hallucinated numbers** — if the data doesn't exist, ask for it
